# Personalized-Medicine-Recommending-system
Medicine is the key to maintain and prolong life. Not all body systems are clinically similar, so the medicine needs to be customized according to the body system of an individual. The ongoing pandemic acts as a burning example as it has been observed that one the set of medicines like Remdisivir, Tocilizumab, etc. works for one category of patients while the same set of medicines cannot prevent another category of patients with almost similar clinical parameters from progressing to severe stage from mild or moderate condition. Personalized medicine can be a solution to this challenge as it has a more “customized” approach. It is also known as precision or individualize or customized medicine.

Personalized medicine recommending systems are designed to provide tailored treatment and healthcare recommendations to individual patients based on their unique genetic, medical, and lifestyle data. These systems leverage advanced technologies like machine learning and bioinformatics to improve patient outcomes and treatment efficacy.

# *Introduction*
Personalized medicine recommendation systems are computer systems that use machine learning to recommend medical treatments and interventions to patients based on their individual characteristics. These systems can be used to improve patient outcomes and to reduce the cost of healthcare.

# *Prerequisites*
To develop a personalized medicine recommendation system using Python, you will need to have the following installed:

* Python 3
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly

# *Data Loading and Text Cleaning*
The first step in developing a personalized medicine recommendation system is to load and clean the data. This involves loading the patient data from a source such as a hospital database or EHR system, and then cleaning the data to remove any errors or inconsistencies.Personalized medicine systems often start by analyzing a patient's genomic data, including DNA sequencing, to identify genetic variations that may influence disease susceptibility or treatment response.

# *Data Visualization*
Once the data is clean, you can use data visualization tools to explore and understand the data. This can help you to identify trends and patterns in the data that can be used to make recommendations.Integration of electronic health records (EHRs) and patient medical histories is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of a patient's health status.

# *Model Training and Building*
Next, you need to train a machine learning model to make recommendations. This involves feeding the model the patient data and letting it learn the relationships between the features and the target variable (i.e., recommended treatment or intervention).Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to mine and analyze large datasets, identifying patterns and correlations between genetic variations, treatment options, and patient outcomes.Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC.


# *Model Validation*
Once the model is trained, you need to evaluate its performance on a held-out validation set. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data.ersonalized medicine systems prioritize the needs and preferences of individual patients, empowering them to make informed decisions about their healthcare.Implement mechanisms for real-time updates to incorporate new research findings and treatment options.

# *Model Testing*
Once you are satisfied with the performance of the model, you can test it on new data. This involves feeding the model new patient data and getting the predicted recommended treatment or intervention.These systems facilitate the exploration of novel treatment options, including targeted therapies and precision drugs.Ethical considerations, such as informed consent and data ownership, must be addressed to maintain ethical standards in personalized medicine.Develop a user-friendly interface for healthcare providers and patients to access and interact with the system.


# *Conclusion*

Personalized medicine recommendation systems using Python are a powerful tool and a promising technique that can be used to improve patient outcomes and to reduce the cost of healthcare. By following the steps outlined above, you can develop Python models that can help you to make more informed recommendations to patients. However, it is important to note that personalized medicine recommendation is a complex task, and no model can make recommendations with perfect accuracy.

It is also important to note that personalized medicine recommendation systems should be used in conjunction with the expertise of a medical professional.
